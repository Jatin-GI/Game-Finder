# üéÆ Game Finder ‚Äì A Smart Steam Game Recommendation System

**Game Finder** is a content-based game recommender system built with **Python**, **NLP**, and **Streamlit**. Instead of requiring users to input specific game names, it allows natural language queries like:

> _"I'm looking for a free open-world multiplayer shooting game with realistic graphics."_

Using **TF-IDF vectorization**, **Porter stemming**, and **cosine similarity**, it finds and recommends the most relevant games from the **Steam store**.

## üß† What Makes Game Finder Unique?

Unlike traditional recommenders based on user ratings or collaborative filtering, Game Finder focuses on **content-based filtering** using:
- Game name
- Description
- Price

üí° This means it can match any user-provided text ‚Äî no prior user data needed!

## üï∏Ô∏è How Data Was Collected

The game data was **scraped directly from Steam** using:
- **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation
- Navigated to [Steam Top Sellers](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers)
- Collected:
  - üéÆ Game name
  - üóìÔ∏è Launch date
  - üí∞ Price
  - üñºÔ∏è Cover image URL
  - üìù Short description

> All data is saved into a CSV (`steam_games_with_description.csv`) and used to power the recommender engine.
